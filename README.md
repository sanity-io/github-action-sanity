# GitHub Action for Sanity.io

This Action wraps the [Sanity CLI](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity) for usage inside workflows.

## Usage

Below are two examples of usage. Do you use this GitHub Action for a different purpose? Submit a pull request!

Depending on your use case, you will need to [generate a read or write token](https://www.sanity.io/docs/http-auth#robot-tokens-4c21d7b829fe) from your project's management console and then [add it as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in the Studio GitHub repository. In the examples below, the secret was named `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN`.

### Studio deployment on push requests

_This workflow requires a read token._

```yaml
name: Deploy Sanity
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  sanity-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    name: Deploy Sanity
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: sanity-io/github-action-sanity@v0.2-alpha
        env:
          SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: deploy
```

### Backup routine

Thanks to [scheduled events](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) and [artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts), you can set up a simple backup routine.

Backup files will appear as downloadable artifacts in the workflow summary. Keep in mind that artifacts are automatically deleted [after a certain period of time](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy) (after 90 days for public repositories).

_This workflow requires a read token._

```yaml
name: Backup Routine
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 04:00 UTC on the 1st and 17th of every month
    - cron: "0 4 */16 * *"
jobs:
  backup-dataset:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    name: Backup dataset
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Export dataset
        uses: sanity-io/github-action-sanity@v0.2-alpha
        env:
          SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: dataset export production backups/backup.tar.gz
      - name: Upload backup.tar.gz
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: backup-tarball
          path: backups/backup.tar.gz
          # Fails the workflow if no files are found; defaults to 'warn'
          if-no-files-found: error
```
